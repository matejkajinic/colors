# WebGL Shader Visualization

Created by Claude (Anthropic AI) on April 2024

## Description

This project provides a simple WebGL-based shader visualization tool. It renders a fullscreen canvas that displays an animated shader effect. The project is designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to experiment with different shader effects.

## Features

- Fullscreen WebGL canvas
- Simple, customizable shader code
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Error reporting for WebGL and shader compilation issues

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with WebGL support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The shader visualization should appear, filling the entire browser window.

## Customization

To modify the shader effect:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the `fragmentShaderSource` variable in the JavaScript section.
3. Modify the GLSL code to create your desired effect.
4. Save the file and refresh your browser to see the changes.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages.
2. Ensure your browser supports WebGL.
3. Verify that your shader code is valid GLSL.
